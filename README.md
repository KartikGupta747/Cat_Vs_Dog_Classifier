# 🐾 Cat vs Dog Classifier

## 🚀 Live Application

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_md_white.svg)](https://catvsdogclassifier-2pk287qpkt7pvmhgswwch6.streamlit.app/)

***

## 💡 Project Overview

Our goal is to accurately classify images as either a 'cat' or a 'dog'.

The classification task is handled by two distinct deep learning models:

1.  **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A custom-built CNN model trained from scratch.
2.  **Transfer Learning Model:** A model leveraging a pre-trained base (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for improved accuracy and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Deployment Framework:** Streamlit
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas
* **Image Processing:** Pillow (PIL)
